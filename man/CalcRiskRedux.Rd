\arguments{
\item{cov}{Outright covariance matrix to be used in the variance calculations}

\item{pos}{A vector of outright positions for which we wish to know the equivalent positions.}

\item{types}{Types of combinations to be calculated from the outright covariance matrix.}

\item{ref.qty}{Reference quantity used to determine what a full traded level would do to risk.}
