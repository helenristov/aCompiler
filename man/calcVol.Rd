\usage{
calcVol(spread, vol.settings, type = "Diff", .combine = TRUE, incr = 0,
  minVol = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{spread}{A price series on which you want to compute the hourly volatility measure over a specified period of time}

\item{type}{The type of volatility to compute. Valid selections are Diff and PBands}

\item{.combine}{A boolean that sets if we want to merge the periods and return the mean of the rolling vol measures over those periods.}

\item{dPeriod}{The number of days used to compute the hourly volatility. Default is set to NA and should be used when selecting PBands type}

\item{dFast}{The number of days for the pbands fast moving average}

\item{dSlow}{The number of days for the pbands slow moving average}
